The aim is to create a website for the scraping - so that anyone else in the company can use this without having to understand the code.

- Flask for backend to connect to files
- HTML, CSS, Javascript for front end - make website look decent (will have to learn these/ get ChatGPT etc to help)
- !! Add Mailto link - this will sort of make it so the emails send automatically
