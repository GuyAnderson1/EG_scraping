# EG_scraping
**Aim** - to scrape data from the Estates Gazette Property Link website - after 18.11.24 all files are scraped by me. Prior to this I used a web scraping software.

**Currently** - emails auto-draft to the agent for any property which has recently come off of EGPL.

**Next** - find a way to make it more usable for anyone. No code visible unless something goes wrong and I have to try and fix it. 

**Data** - all commercial rent properties in Bath. Maybe adding Bristol as well in the future, however it is a much larger dataset & apparently the Bath commercial property rental market is a very closed loop - easier to get emails to send.
