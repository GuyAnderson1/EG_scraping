# EG_scraping
Aim: to scrape data from the Estates Gazette Property Link website - after 18.11.24 all files are scraped by me. Prior to this I used a web scraping software.

Currently - emails auto-draft to the agent for any property which has recently come off of EGPL.

****Next**** -  

Data: all commercial rent properties in Bath. (Bristol aswell?)
